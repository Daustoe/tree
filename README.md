Trees in Python
====

Simple Python Tree implementations:
-- simple_tree.py --
Unbalanced binary tree

-- avl_tree.py --
AVL balanced binary tree. Implemented using a recursive method.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree

    Supports the following functionality:
    -insertion
    -removal
    -enumeration
        --can enumerate any attribute of the Node in order.
    -search
    -least
    -greatest
    -singleton creation (create avl tree with one node)

    Functionality that I want to add:
    -comparison between trees
    -different types of enumeration
    -graft (insert another tree)
    -prune (remove entire branch under node)
